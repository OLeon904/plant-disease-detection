### **INTRODUCTION (1 minute)**

**[Slide 1: Title]**
"Plant Disease Detection using Swin Transformer"
- Deep Learning for Computer Vision
- Octavia Leon
- July 2024

**[Voiceover]**
"Welcome to my deep learning project on plant disease detection. Today, I'll demonstrate how we can use artificial intelligence to automatically detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.76%."

### **PROBLEM STATEMENT (1.5 minutes)**

**[Slide 2: Problem Overview]**
- Plant diseases threaten global food security
- Traditional detection methods are:
  - Time-consuming (manual inspection)
  - Labor-intensive (requires experts)
  - Subjective (human error)
  - Expensive (specialized knowledge)

**[Slide 3: Impact Statistics]**
- 20-40% crop losses annually due to plant diseases
- $220 billion economic impact globally
- Need for early detection and rapid response

**[Voiceover]**
"Plant diseases pose a significant threat to global food security, causing 20-40% crop losses annually with an economic impact of $220 billion. Traditional detection methods rely on manual inspection by agricultural experts, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often subjective. We need an automated solution that can provide rapid, accurate disease detection."

### **SOLUTION APPROACH (2 minutes)**

**[Slide 4: Deep Learning Solution]**
- **Traditional Methods vs. Deep Learning:**
  - Traditional: Rule-based, hand-crafted features
  - Deep Learning: Automatic feature learning, end-to-end

**[Slide 5: Swin Transformer Architecture]**
- **Why Swin Transformer?**
  - Hierarchical feature learning
  - Shifted window attention mechanism
  - Linear computational complexity
  - State-of-the-art performance

**[Slide 6: Model Specifications]**
- Architecture: Swin Transformer Base
- Parameters: 86.8M
- Input: 224Ã—224 RGB images
- Output: 38 disease categories
