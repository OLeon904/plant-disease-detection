## 1. Introduction and Background

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Plant diseases pose a significant threat to global food security, causing substantial crop losses annually. Traditional methods of disease detection rely heavily on manual inspection by agricultural experts, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often subjective. Early detection and accurate classification of plant diseases are crucial for effective crop management and sustainable agriculture.

### 1.2 Significance of Deep Learning in Plant Disease Detection
Deep learning has revolutionized plant disease detection by offering several advantages over traditional image processing techniques:

**Traditional Methods vs. Deep Learning:**
- **Traditional**: Rule-based feature extraction, limited to hand-crafted features
- **Deep Learning**: Automatic feature learning, hierarchical representation
- **Traditional**: Requires domain expertise for feature engineering
- **Deep Learning**: End-to-end learning from raw images
- **Traditional**: Poor generalization across different conditions
- **Deep Learning**: Robust to variations in lighting, angle, and scale

### 1.3 Challenges in Plant Pathology
- **Dataset Variability**: Different lighting conditions, angles, and image quality
- **Environmental Conditions**: Seasonal changes, weather effects on leaf appearance
- **Disease Symptoms**: Similar visual symptoms across different diseases
- **Class Imbalance**: Uneven distribution of disease samples
- **Real-time Requirements**: Need for fast inference in field conditions
